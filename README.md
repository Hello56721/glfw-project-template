# GLFW Template

A simple template project for getting started with GLFW in C++. I created this in the hope that it would be useful for anyone getting started with GLFW and OpenGL. It is configured to hide all of the complicated configuration files when you open it in VS Code, along with a bunch of useful scripts to avoid getting into the nitty-gritty details of CMake. In other words, it's the noob's kit to GLFW and OpenGL.

## How to Use

**Step 1.** Write your program in `main.cpp`, or use that as a starting point.

**Step 2.** Open a terminal in the project folder.

**Step 3.** Run `./init.sh` to initialize the project.

**Step 4.** Run `./compile.sh` to compile the project.

**Step 5.** Run `./glfw-project` to run the project.
